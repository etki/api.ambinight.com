# api.ambinight.com

This project contains API work for my artist site, ambinight.com.

## What's inside?

A simple Symfony project.

## How is this thing deployed?

TBD

## Anything other need to be known?

TBD

## Why PHP?

My main language is still Java, however, i meet PHP in my work on a 
regular basis, sometimes i need to integrate new software i haven't 
experience with, e.g. [Phinx][phinx] or [Rocketeer][rocketeer]. Because
of that, and because i don't want my knowledge and skill to stall and 
degrade, i chose to implement this project using Symfony.

  [phinx]: https://phinx.org/
  [rocketeer]: https://rocketeer.autopergamene.eu
